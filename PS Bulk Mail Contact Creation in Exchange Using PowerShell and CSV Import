# What It Does Overall
# This script bulk-creates mail contacts in Exchange using data from a CSV file.
# Each contact:

# Has a name and external email address.
# Is stored in the specified OU.

# Use Case

# Common in hybrid or on-prem Exchange environments.
# Useful for adding external recipients (vendors, partners) to distribution groups without creating full mailboxes.

}

# Example CSV:
# Name,Email
# John Doe,john.doe@example.com
# Jane Smith,jane.smith@example.com
