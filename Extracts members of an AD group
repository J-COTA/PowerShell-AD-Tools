##What Does It Do Overall?
##It generates a report of all members in the AD group, including:

##Their username (samAccountName)
##Their display name
##Their job title

##And saves this report as a CSV file for easy viewing or sharing.

##Performance Note:
##For large groups, this script can be slow because it calls Get-ADUser for each member individually. A more efficient way is to use Get-ADUser with a filter or Get-ADGroupMember combined with Get-ADUser in a single pipeline.

Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "AD_Group_Name" |
Select samAccountName,
    @{Name="DisplayName";Expression={(Get-ADUser $_.distinguishedName -Properties Displayname).Displayname}},
    @{Name="Title";Expression={(Get-ADUser $_.distinguishedName -Properties Title).title}} |
Export-CSV "c:\DIR\AD_Group_Name.csv"
